PDEContRoLGym Documentation
=========================================

The PDEContRoLGym is a benchmark containing a series of 1D and 2D problems for PDE control. It is designed for control theory by control theorists with the aim for easy use with Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 

Github Repository: https://github.com/lukebhan/PDEControlGym

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14265

Pre-Trained Models: https://huggingface.co/lukebhan/PDEControlGymModels

We strongly recommend first installing the gym following the instructions in the `documentation here <../guide/install.html>`_. Then, we recommmend exploring the Jupyter-notebooks in the example tutorial found `here <../guide/tutorials.html>`_.

Main Features
--------------

- Fully worked examples
- Plug and play with any RL gym. 
- Designed for control theory - not just "PDE solvers"
- Unified structure for all algorithms
- PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
- Documented functions and classes
